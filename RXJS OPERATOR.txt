RXJS Operators
   

    operators are also known as pure functions.

        pure functions will don,t have any side effects
        function will return the same value when passed with same input value
            ex; when we have a addition function of two number 
                we will get the same value for the same parameters


                Types of Operators
                Creation
                Mathematical
                Join
                Transformation
                Filtering
                Utility
                Conditional
                Multi Casting
                Error Handling




OF Operators

 by using the of operator we can set the value for the Observables typical setting valuesn are string,object,array


 use cases 
   converting the array object string into type Observables using of opertaor


From Operators

    from Operators will create an Observables from an array , an array like a object ,promise, an iterable object
    or an observable like an object

    Remember it will always take an array or array like an object

    If we give a string or object value to from opertaor observable, it will through errors


FromEvent Operators

    its helps to create an observable which where emits from an events like(click,blur,focus,etc)

    In Angular
       Binding The events
       use viewChild,NativeElements as target element and bind events
